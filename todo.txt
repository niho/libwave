[x] public API for encoder events
[X] settings for init
[x] resume recording sessions
[X] error callback
[x] encoder write callback needs to return the number of bytes written to file
[x] close any encoder files on deinit
[ ] desired settings vs actual
[ ] remove platform_util, handle encoder support with ifdefs
[ ] init kowalski with custom io callbacks
[ ] portaudio external location
[X] report recorded time
[x] finish recording during pause might not work
[ ] make sure clip flag persists until queried
[x] cancel/finish -> stop recording

[ ] Verify FIFO data integrity when it arrives on the main thread
[ ] Don't drive the polling from a loop that pauses during scrolls (i.e NSTimer)
[ ] Handle FIFO underruns somehow, generate 
[ ] iOS input level adjust?
[X] ditch/refactor kowalski to avoid mutexes, create thin wrapper around portaudio and remoteio?
[ ] actually record chunks of MAX_RECORDED_CHUNK_SIZE instead of current buffer size
[ ] check the actual number of input channels + fs before using
[X] make encoder callbacks return error codes
