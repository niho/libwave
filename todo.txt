[ ] public API for encoder events
[X] settings for init
[ ] resume recording sessions
[X] error callback
[ ] encoder write callback needs to return the number of bytes written to file
[ ] close any encoder files on deinit
[ ] desired settings vs actual
[ ] remove platform_util, handle encoder support with ifdefs



[ ] Associate recording sessions with handles, to make it possible to resume sessions
[ ] Verify FIFO data integrity when it arrives on the main thread
[ ] Don't drive the polling from a loop that pauses during scrolls (i.e NSTimer)
[ ] Handle FIFO underruns somehow, generate 
[ ] iOS input level adjust?
[X] ditch/refactor kowalski to avoid mutexes, create thin wrapper around portaudio and remoteio?
[ ] actually record chunks of MAX_RECORDED_CHUNK_SIZE instead of current buffer size
[ ] check the actual number of input channels + fs before using
[X] make encoder callbacks return error codes
